# Module9-Surfs_Up


##Purpose of the project:
<br>
Surfing is the greatest pation of mine and decided to combine it with business. Last time when we were in Oahu I had an idea of having a surf shop in this island.
W Avy is an investor who I found to turn my idea into reality, however since his last surf shop experiance which did not end sucessfylly, he want to make sure about the weather conditions.<br>

Precipitaion is important, there needs to be enough rain to keep everything green, but not so much that you lose out on that ideal surfing and ice cream weather. 

Our job is to calculate the precipitation and temperature statistics for the provided date range (between August 23, 2016 and August 23, 2017) in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Analysis
Picking a month in summer and a month in winter will give us an idea of what is the year around prospect for the business.
Lets start with June as our summer month: After running our Summary Statistics for June code we found;
we have creaed [surfsup_challange code](https://github.com/4renginy/Module9-Surfs_Up/blob/main/SurfsUp_Challange.ipynb)in order to find the statistics. The best thing about this code is it would be used for any other monts too.
